## Resoures
Software:
- Jupyter notebook 6.4.8
- Python 3.10 (64-bit)

## Overview
This projecte required me to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I then created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  Based on results summarize the findings. The PyBer results could help determine affordability and improve access to additional neighborhoods in need of a ride sharing service.
